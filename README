This is a set of scripts which automate the whole OS X .pkg and .dmg construction
for any folder you point it to. See the makefile for usage example.

The resulting package should during installation get under controll of pkgutil.
One can check it is installed using:
$ pkgutil --packages

Pkgutil can also remove it via (careful with this one, use only if you know what
exactly it is doing):
$ pkgutil --unlink

And one can make the system forget about it using:
$ pkgutil --forget
